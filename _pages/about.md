Hello!  I am a computational social scientist in the 4th year of my PhD in the [Software and Societal Systems](https://s3d.cmu.edu) department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy, advised by [Professor Kathleen M. Carley](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html).  I'm broadly interested in studying judgments and decision making in digital contexts.  Using a combination of large-scale computational analyses and experiments, I examine how social media influences perceptions of social reality. This includes work on impression management and formation, persuasion, and misinformation.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated summa cum laude from the College of William & Mary with a B.S. in Applied and Pure Mathematics and minor in Computer Science.  I recieved honors for my senior thesis, [A Survey of Methods to Determine Quantum Symmetry of Graphs](https://scholarworks.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2657&context=honorstheses), thanks largely to my amazing advisors [Dr. Eric Swartz](https://www.math.wm.edu/~eswartz/) and [Dr. Pierre Clare](https://prclare.people.wm.edu).  I also had the privilege to work with [Dr. Luke A. Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukealanjohnson/) at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, where I contributed to methods for modeling air plasma chemistry.

Outside of work, I like to sing and do fiber arts.
